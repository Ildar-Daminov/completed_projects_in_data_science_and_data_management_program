### Context 
A money-free bank conducts a telemarketing campaign every quarter to promote its Term Deposit Product. However, the previous campaign did not fulfil their anticipations. To start a new campaign again a thorough analysis of previous campaigns' customer behaviour is needed. As a Data Scientist, you must analyze the data to identify which factors have significant impact on customers' deposits and then develop a predictive model that can predict whether customers will subscribe to the Term Deposit.
